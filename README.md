This repository contains code accompanying our paper ["Observability of Hypergraphs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04883) *IEEE CDC 2023*

Authors: Joshua Pickard (jpic@umich.edu), [Amit Surana](https://sites.google.com/site/amitsur99/home?authuser=0), [Anthony Bloch](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~abloch/), [Indika Rajapakse](https://rajapakse.lab.medicine.umich.edu/home)

## Software Dependencies:
- [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- [Hypergraph Analysis Toolbox (HAT)](https://hypergraph-analysis-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Mouse Endoscopy Dataset

The mouse endomicroscpy dataset used to construct figure 3 can be found in `data/mouse_fed_fasted_refed.csv`. This data comes from [Network dynamics of hypothalamic feeding neurons](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2011140118), and its hypergraph representation and dynamics have been studied previously in [Controllability of Hypergraphs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384322). For information on the original data processing, consult the original paper.
